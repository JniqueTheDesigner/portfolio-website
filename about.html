                        <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <p>Hi ! My name is Jasmin Hamilton</p>
                        <p>I also go by Jnique which is my artist name that I go by in music. My
                            background starts in music and entertainment as an Audio Engineer &
                            Music Producer. I’ve been in production since I was 16, interning in
                            recording studios after school and learning music since I was in grade
                            school.</p>
                        <p>I’ve always been the kid that wanted to be hands on when learning, you
                            couldn't just tell me how to play the drums. I needed to have the
                            drumsticks in my hands and find the rhythm for myself. Crazy thing is
                            music and production never came easy for me and it frustrated me to not be able to do the things
                            I’m most fascinated by with ease, but something in me always said “we gotta try again Jazz” Now as
                            an adult that's my approach. I’ve come to appreciate & fall in love with the process more than the
                            result, that's why I’ve become so good at developing concepts to design. It’s the challenge in the
                            process, and the beauty in the outcome that captivates me.</p>
                        <p>Anyone that knows me will tell you once I’m interested or have my mind set I’m locked in. I’m
                            reaching out to the people I need to work with to make it happen, I’m utilizing my resources to
                            become well informed regarding the subject matter, and strategize a plan of action.</p>
                        <p>As a UI/UX Designer that produces concepts to design. I have the skill of producing successful
                            outcomes from first breaking down big ideas into smaller manageable pieces, then forming a plan of
                            execution. I am a Creative at heart, I’m always drawn to the aesthetic and appeal of a brand, but I
                            balance it with being cognitive to data and analytics using it sparingly in marketing and branding.</p>
